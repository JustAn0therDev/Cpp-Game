# Cpp-Game
~A game I'm making in C++.~ 

It ended up becoming a Snake Game clone. It's pretty simple to read the code and to compile, as well as downloading and playing it.

Just download the `Release.rar` file and extract it to some directory. From there, open the `Cpp Game.exe` file and you're playing the game.
Please do not delete the font file that comes with the executable, since it's necessary to show the text in the UI.

To quit, close the window or press `Esc` on your keyboard.
